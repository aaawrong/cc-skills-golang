# Claude Code Skills for production-ready Golang projects

AI agent skills are reusable instruction sets that extend your coding assistant with domain-specific expertise — loaded on demand so they don't bloat your context. This repository covers **Go-specific** skills only (language, testing, security, observability, etc.); for dev workflow skills (git conventions, CI/CD, PR reviews) you'll want to add a separate skills plugin.

For generic skills, please visit [cc-skills](https://github.com/samber/cc-skills).

## 🧩 Skills

These skills are designed as **atomic, cross-referencing units**. A skill may reference conventions defined in another (e.g. error-handling rules that affect logging live in `golang-error-handling`, not `golang-observability`). Installing only a subset will give you a partial — and potentially inconsistent — view of the guidelines. For best results, install all general-purpose skills together.

Each skill lives in `skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` entry point. The `SKILL.md` is kept small with internal references to advanced markdown files, so only the relevant content is loaded into context.

- **Description (tok)** — weight of the `description` field from YAML frontmatter, always loaded into Claude's context for skill triggering
- **SKILL.md (tok)** — weight of the full `SKILL.md` file loaded when the skill triggers
- **Directory (tok)** — weight of all files in the skill directory (SKILL.md + referenced markdown files)

Skills marked with ⭐️ are recommended as a starting point for most Go projects.

Token counts are measured with `npm exec -- tiktoken-cli --exclude "evals" skills/{name}/`. Description tokens extracted with:

```bash
awk 'NR==1 && /^---$/{found=1; next} found && /^---$/{exit} found && /^description:/{print}' skills/<name>/SKILL.md | npx tiktoken-cli
```

## 🎯 Tuning Skill Triggers

If a skill triggers too often or not often enough, please [open an issue](https://github.com/samber/cc-skills-golang/issues) suggesting a description change. The `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary triggering mechanism — small wording adjustments can significantly improve trigger accuracy. Some `SKILL.md` might have `When to use` section which is another level of exclusion. Finally, `SKILL.md` are a entrypoint for lazy loading references with deep knowledge located in `references/`.

## 🔄 Overlap

Claude reports very little overlap between skills in this repo, thanks to cross-reference. I suggest enabling most of the skills and leverage lazy loading. The recommended ⭐️ skills load ~1,100 tokens of descriptions at startup; full skill content is only pulled in when relevant. Note:

- I estimate that 50% of `golang-naming` and `golang-code-style` overlap with linters (golangci-lint).
- A large part of the security rules in `golang-security` have been distilled from Bearer (SAST) check list. The skill is still useful for methodology.
- If your team has its own conventions, create a company skill and declare the override explicitly near the top of its body: `"This skill supersedes \`samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-naming\` skill for [company] projects."` Skills marked ⚙️ in the table above support this mechanism.

## ✍️ Contribute

- **100 tokens per skill description** - what ? when use this skill ?
- **1.000–2.500 tokens per SKILL.md** — keep the main file focused on essentials
- **Use secondary markdown files for depth** — reference them from SKILL.md with relative links (e.g., `[Logging](./logging.md)`). Claude reads these on demand when the topic is relevant, so they don't count against the context budget until needed
- **Up to 10.000 tokens** for full skill and secondary files
- **2–4 skills loaded simultaneously** in a typical session — design skills to coexist
- **Stay below ~10k tokens of total loaded SKILL.md** anytime to avoid degrading response quality

For more guidelines, please check `CLAUDE.md`.
